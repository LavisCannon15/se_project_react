# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

WTWR (What to Wear?) is a full-stack web application that allows users to keep track of their clothing items and suggests suitable outfits based on local weather conditions. The application uses data from a weather API to display current weather information and recommend clothing items that are appropriate for the day. Users can create an account and add their clothing items to the app's database. The app also allows users to browse through their collection of clothing items, mark their favorites, and delete items. The website is built using React, Node.js, and Express.js, and the data is stored in MongoDB. The application is deployed using Google Cloud and Nginx.
